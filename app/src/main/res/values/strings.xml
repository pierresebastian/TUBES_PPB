    <string name="store_desc"><b>peaceminusone</b> is a Korean clothing brand that began in 2016 under artist G-DRAGON from BIGBANG.
        The brand was created with the help of his stylist Gee Eun and is an extension of G-DRAGON’spersona.
        The logo for peaceminusone was first seen on his solo album COUP D’ETAT that was released back in 2013.
        Not only does it look like a peace sign, it actually derives from combining the G and the D in his name.</string>
    <string name="exhibition">The brand began its first creative experience with a limited exhibition in 2015 located in the Seoul
        Museum of Art called peaceminusone: Beyond the Stage. The exhibition was created to show the world that G-DRAGON perceives and reflects upon human nature while also showing a perfect utopia as the world “peace” implies.
        It also brought together both pop culture and modern art with collaborations between various artists and G-DRAGON, as well as various items from BIGBANG videos.</string>
